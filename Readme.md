### em-dragons

The main command is `cargo unleash em-dragons`, here is its help. All subcommands have extensive `--help` for you.

```bash
$ unleash em-dragons --help

Unleash 'em dragons

Package all selected crates, check them and attempt to publish them.

USAGE:
    unleash em-dragons [FLAGS] [OPTIONS]

FLAGS:
        --build
            Actually build the package in check

            By default, this only runs `cargo check` against the package build. Set this flag to have it run an actual
            `build` instead.
        --dry-run
            dry run

    -h, --help
            Prints help information

        --ignore-publish
            Ignore whether `publish` is set.

            If nothing else is specified `publish = true` is assumed for every package. If publish is set to false or
            any registry, it is ignore by default. If you want to include it regardless, set this flag.
        --include-dev-deps
            Do not disable dev-dependencies

            By default we disable dev-dependencies before the run.
        --no-check
            dry run

    -V, --version
            Prints version information


OPTIONS:
        --owner <add-owner>
            Ensure we have the owner set as well

    -i, --ignore-pre-version <ignore-pre-version>...
            Ignore version pre-releases

            Skip if the SemVer pre-release field is any of the listed. Mutually exclusive with `--package`
    -p, --packages <packages>...
            Only use the specfic set of packages

            Apply only to the packages named as defined. This is mutually exclusive with skip and ignore-version-pre.
            Default: []
    -s, --skip <skip>...
            skip the package names matching ...

            Provide one or many regular expression that, if the package name matches, means we skip that package.
            Mutually exclusive with `--package`
        --token <token>
             [env: CRATES_TOKEN]

```

## Common Usage Examples

**Release all crates** not having the `-dev`-pre version set
```bash
unleash em-dragons --ignore-pre-version dev
```

**Release all crates** not having `test` in the name
```bash
unleash em-dragons --skip test
```

**Set the pre-version to `-dev`**
```bash
unleash version set-pre dev
```

**Bump the pre-version**, so for e.g. from `alpha.1` to `alpha.2` or `beta.3` to `beta.4`:
```bash
unleash version bump-pre
```
